This is my guitar hero project.
To run this code you should run the File called FINAL.py
ALl the files in the compressed folder are needed to run the game. 
The libraries I used are pygame version 1.9.1 , random, and time. They must work on the computer for the code to run.

This game runs perfectly on mac. It runs on windows too, the only difference is that the animation runs faster. The game is too fast for the mortals to play.
